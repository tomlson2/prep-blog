# prep-blog
blog highlighting my cs interview prep journey.

This website uses hugo to easily deploy a static website that documents my software engineering interview prep without the bloat of unnecessary javascript or dynamic features.

I have started to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)to take notes and track learning. Because obsidian uses markdown, I am then able to publish the exact same (almost) files right to the blog. It comes together all thanks to [this](https://github.com/devidw/obsidian-to-hugo) python script by devidw.
